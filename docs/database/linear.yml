title: Linear energy optimization
type: Entry
description: Perform energy optimization using the method very similar to the one
  described by Umrigar and coworkers in Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 110201 (2007).
required: []
optional:
- default: '16384'
  description: Total number of VMC steps to perform when calculating the Hamiltonian
    matrix. This is the most important variable to increase when improving the accuracy.
  keyword: TOTAL_NSTEP
  type: Integer
- default: '1024'
  description: Number of configurations to use when calculating the step size using
    correlated sampling.
  keyword: TOTAL_FIT
  type: Integer
- default: runid.wfout
  description: Choose the filename to place an input deck for the final wavefunction
    and intermediate ones as the optimization continues.
  keyword: WFOUTPUT
  type: String
- default: '30'
  description: Number of optimization iterations.
  keyword: ITERATIONS
  type: Integer
- default: '0.001'
  description: Stop run when changes in energy are less than this value (in Hartrees).
  keyword: EN_CONVERGENCE
  type: Float

advanced:
- default: TOTALNSTEP/nprocs
  description: Number of VMC steps to perform per processor to collect statistics
    on the Hamiltonian matrix.
  keyword: VMC_NSTEP
  type: Integer
- default: '0.99'
  description: Fraction of the original wave function to keep per step.  This is a
    stabilization parameter.
  keyword: MINIMUM_PSI0

- default: 4*VMCNSTEP
  description: The optimization method will increase VMCNSTEP automatically if certain
    significance requirements are not met in the Hamiltonian matrix.  This variable
    limits how much VMCNSTEP can be increased.
  keyword: MAX_VMC_NSTEP
  type: Integer
- default: TOTALFIT/nprocs
  description: The number of configurations per processor used to evaluate the step
    size.  This is adjusted automatically to ensure statistical significance.
